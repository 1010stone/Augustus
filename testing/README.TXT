1. Basic tests
A basic test consists in a sequence one or more nucleotides have been added to. At those sites Augustus is asked to apply fs. 
The test succeedes if the applying Augustus with fs option enabled to the modified sequence produces the same gff you can obtain
by applying Augustus with fs option disabled at the original sequence.
This is intended to be a basic test to verify that fs at any site is performed without any side-effect to the preexisting code.
