- check if halLiftover is symmetric, meaning that mapping (genome i -> genome j)
  is the same as maping (genome j -> genome i). If so, halLiftover
  can be reduced to the cases above the diagonal

- add support for other gene features such as UTR exons

- handle multiple transcripts per gene

- catch exceptions from threads

- hints: handle missing frame/strand, allow hints
  not in the predicted gene set
