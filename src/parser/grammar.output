Production Rules
(rule precedences determined from %prec or 1st terminal between parentheses):
1: tree (';') ->  subtree ';'
2: subtree ->  leaf
3: subtree ('(') ->  '(' branchset ')'
4: leaf (SPECIES) ->  SPECIES
5: branchset ->  branch
6: branchset (',') ->  branchset ',' branch
7: branch (':') ->  subtree ':' DISTANCE
8: tree_$ ->  tree


Symbolic Terminal tokens:
       error
       EOF
   257: DISTANCE
   258: SPECIES
    59: ';'
    40: '('
    41: ')'
    44: ','
    58: ':'


Grammar States: 
State 0:
8: tree_$ ->  . tree 
  0:   On tree to state 1
  1:   On subtree to state 2
  2:   On leaf to state 3
  3:   On '(' to state 4
  4:   On SPECIES to state 5


State 1:
8: tree_$ -> tree  . 


State 2:
1: tree -> subtree  . ';' 
  0:   On ';' to state 6


State 3:
2: subtree -> leaf  . 
  Reduce by 2: subtree -> leaf  . 


State 4:
3: subtree -> '('  . branchset ')' 
  0:   On branchset to state 7
  1:   On branch to state 8
  2:   On subtree to state 9
  3:   On leaf to state 3
  4:   On '(' to state 4
  5:   On SPECIES to state 5


State 5:
4: leaf -> SPECIES  . 
  Reduce by 4: leaf -> SPECIES  . 


State 6:
1: tree -> subtree ';'  . 
  Reduce by 1: tree -> subtree ';'  . 


State 7:
3: subtree -> '(' branchset  . ')' 
6: branchset -> branchset  . ',' branch 
  0:   On ')' to state 10
  1:   On ',' to state 11


State 8:
5: branchset -> branch  . 
  Reduce by 5: branchset -> branch  . 


State 9:
7: branch -> subtree  . ':' DISTANCE 
  0:   On ':' to state 12


State 10:
3: subtree -> '(' branchset ')'  . 
  Reduce by 3: subtree -> '(' branchset ')'  . 


State 11:
6: branchset -> branchset ','  . branch 
  0:   On branch to state 13
  1:   On subtree to state 9
  2:   On leaf to state 3
  3:   On '(' to state 4
  4:   On SPECIES to state 5


State 12:
7: branch -> subtree ':'  . DISTANCE 
  0:   On DISTANCE to state 14


State 13:
6: branchset -> branchset ',' branch  . 
  Reduce by 6: branchset -> branchset ',' branch  . 


State 14:
7: branch -> subtree ':' DISTANCE  . 
  Reduce by 7: branch -> subtree ':' DISTANCE  .
