DEPENDENCIES
please make sure boost-serialization-dev is installed. If it is not the case, try and run:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libboost-serialization-dev

1) RUN and EVAL modes to predict over the minimal data set and assess accuracy
After having assigned the path to eval to eval_dir within script/executeTestCGP.py, run the following commands from within Augustus-testing_dataset/scripts :

YOURPYTHON executeTestCGP.py --chunk=1 --run

it runs prediction using minimal FASTAs (expected running time 1h c.ca), results are stored in example/cgp12way/out1run

YOURPYTHON executeTestCGP.py --chunk=1 --eval 

it computes accuracy for prediction obtained using minimal FASTAs, results are stored in example/cgp12way/out1result


The following modes are used only when creating a new data set (bedtools required)
2) PREDICT mode to run original cmpAugustus prediction
3) TEST mode to run a test concerning the crrectness in the use of minimal FASTAs
4) PREPARE to build new data sets
