This README file is part of the master thesis:

Alignment of Protein to Protein Family Using Intron Information
by Lars Gabriel


List of contends in the Augustus directory that is added for this master thesis:
    1. src/pp_simScore:
        The main program for this thesis to compute the similarity algorithm
        A detatiled description can be found in README_ppsimscore.doc
        The code for this program is found in:  src/pp_simscore.cc
                                                include/pp_simscore.hh
        Additionally, the data structure in src/pp_profile.cc and include/pp_profile.hh was extended with a intron profiles.
        A line section that was added can be idetified by //Author Lars Gabriel above it.
    2. masterthesis_larsgabriel:
        This readme file and README_ppsimscore.doc are located here.
        Additionally, examples are given in separate folders. These include an orignal protein sequence, an alternative sequence that is predicted to the original protein and the associated intron-block-profile. Details can be found in a separate README.doc in each folder.
